CLARIFY (CONSTRAINTS)
Ask clarifying questions
(data structure, number of items and size/length of each item)
Example (big enough not too large) 
Suggest will take care of already sorted (increasing, decreasing, duplicates)

CONCEIVE )COLLUDE
Brute force first
Use all the data available in the question
Try to find simple solution first, can you solve subset of the problem and then generalize?
Think out loud, you don’t want to brainstorm silently
Practice problem solving to be able to get it done faster
Try to simply - can you focus on a subset and generalize?
 Don't stress – practice to avoid being too stressed during the interview
Improve with better data structure (hash table, heap or BST)
Make things simpler for yourself. Write down an example on the board and think about just solving that particular instance of the problem by hand.
Not thinking about an algorithm but brain.
A lot of times thoughts would come to you, but you won’t say them out loud, either because it’s too obvious or you think it might be wrong.
optimize a problem using dynamic programming, it must have optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. MAX, MIN.etc 

CONTRACT
Verify function signature - confirm requirements
Contract specifies arguments and return value
Write Class or Function (best to use Class and main)
C++ (use std::string for strings, vectors for arrays)

CODE
Talk through the solution first before coding to make sure you’re on the same page with interviewer
Say which language you are using to make sure interviewer knows what to expect
Insure inputs (nulls, empty, sizes) are taken care of and return fast
Take care of corner cases and easy cases first – this way you won’t forget about it once you dig in
Don't code in silent - talk about what you're doing and why
Can use // Comment for speed but if easy code it out.
Go through Example as you review code
Testing on example helps you catch bugs before interviewer has to point them out
Running time for General Example
Readability is important

CONFIRM (TEST)
Practice with whiteboard or piece of paper
Test nulls, empty string, out of range sizes 
Make sure program doesn’t crash
Use Example first run. the examples you ran through would serve as test cases when you implement the algorithm and have to test your code.
Use Edge Case examples - already sorted (increasing, decreasing, duplicates)
Running time for Best, Worse Cases
